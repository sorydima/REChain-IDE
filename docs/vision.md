# Vision

REChain aims to become an IDE operating system for AI-assisted software development.

## North star
- Multi-model coordination with deterministic outcomes.
- Privacy-first execution with local and edge computation.
- Spatial code navigation as a first-class interface.

## Principles
- Interoperability over lock-in.
- Observable and auditable execution.
- Modular components that can be swapped independently.
