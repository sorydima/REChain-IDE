# Overview

REChain Quantum-CrossAI IDE Engine is an open architecture for a multi-model, distributed IDE runtime. It coordinates model drivers, policy-controlled execution, RAG retrieval, and IDE surfaces.

## What exists now
- Orchestrator service (task routing and merge)
- Kernel service (policy and sandbox stub)
- RAG service (index/search)
- Web6-3D service (graph stub)
- VS Code extension scaffold

## What’s next
- Replace stub drivers with real model backends.
- Add robust sandboxing and policy enforcement.
- Integrate richer code graph and 3D viewer.
