# FAQ

## What is the MVP?
A minimal set of services: orchestrator, kernel, RAG, and a 3D viewer stub, plus a VS Code command to submit tasks.

## Is this production-ready?
No. This is a scaffold for architecture and integration work.

## Why Go?
We use Go for its simplicity and strong standard library for services.

## How do I run it locally?
See docs/runbook.md and docs/dev-setup.md.
