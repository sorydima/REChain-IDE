### Commit
A saved change to a file or set of files in a version control system.

### Container
A lightweight, standalone, executable software package that includes everything needed to run an application.

## D

### Debugging
The process of finding and resolving defects or problems within a computer program that prevent correct operation.

### Dependency
A relationship between software components where one component relies on another to function properly.

### Deployment
The process of making a software application available for use.

### Distributed System

### Environment
A specific configuration of software and hardware in which a program runs.

## F

### Feature Branch
A branch in version control created to develop a specific feature.

### Fork
A copy of a repository that allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project.

## G

### Git
A distributed version control system for tracking changes in source code during software development.

### GitHub
A web-based platform for version control and collaboration that uses Git.

### GitLab
A web-based DevOps lifecycle tool that provides a Git repository manager providing wiki, issue-tracking and CI/CD pipeline features.

## H

### Hook
A mechanism that allows you to trigger actions automatically in response to certain events.

## I

### IDE (Integrated Development Environment)
A software application that provides comprehensive facilities to computer programmers for software development.

### Integration
The process of combining software components into a unified system.

### Issue
A task, bug, or feature request tracked in a project management system.

## K

### Kernel
The core component of an operating system that manages system resources and communication between hardware and software components.

### Kubernetes
An open-source container orchestration platform for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.

## L

### Linter
A tool that analyzes source code to flag programming errors, bugs, stylistic errors, and suspicious constructs.

## M

### Merge
The process of combining changes from different branches in version control.

### Merge Request
A request to merge changes from one branch into another, typically used in GitLab.

### Microservice
An architectural style that structures an application as a collection of loosely coupled services.

### Module
A self-contained unit of code that provides specific functionality.

## N

### Node
A single machine or virtual machine in a distributed system.

## O

### Orchestrator
A component that manages and coordinates the execution of multiple services or processes.

### Optimization
The process of making a system or design as effective or functional as possible.

## P

### Pipeline
A series of automated processes that software goes through from development to deployment.

### Pull Request
A request to merge changes from one branch into another, typically used in GitHub.

## Q

### Quantum Computing
A type of computing that uses quantum-mechanical phenomena to perform operations on data.

### Quantum Algorithm
An algorithm designed to run on a quantum computer.

## R

### Repository
A storage location for software packages and version-controlled files.

### REST (Representational State Transfer)
An architectural style for designing networked applications.

## S

### Schema
A blueprint that defines the structure and constraints of data.

### Service
A self-contained software component that provides specific functionality.

### Stack Trace
A report of the active stack frames at a certain point in time during the execution of a program.

## T

### Tag
A reference to a specific commit in version control, typically used to mark releases.

### Test Coverage
A measure of how much of the source code is executed during testing.

### Thread
The smallest unit of execution within a process.

## U

### Unit Test
A type of automated test that verifies the functionality of a small, isolated piece of code.

### Update
A change or modification to existing software.

## V

### Version Control
A system that records changes to files over time so that you can recall specific versions later.

### Virtual Environment
An isolated Python environment that allows you to manage dependencies for different projects separately.

## W

### Webhook
A way for an app to provide other applications with real-time information through HTTP callbacks.

### Workflow
A sequence of automated processes that software goes through from development to deployment.

## Y

### YAML (YAML Ain't Markup Language)
A human-readable data serialization standard that can be used in conjunction with all programming languages.

## Z

### Zero Downtime Deployment
A deployment strategy that allows new code to be released without causing any downtime for users.

## Additional Terms
