# AGENTS.md

Purpose: This repo hosts the scaffold and docs for the REChain Quantum-CrossAI IDE Engine.

## Operating rules
- Keep changes small and reviewable.
- Prefer PowerShell one-liners for simple file edits.
- Use ASCII unless a file already contains non-ASCII.
- Do not delete existing user content without explicit request.

## Repo layout
- rechain-ide/ contains module folders.
- README.md is the primary overview and product brief.

## Writing style
- Use clear, concrete language.
- Avoid marketing exaggeration; keep claims scoped to the MVP.
- Prefer bullets for lists.

## If unsure
- Ask for clarification before making speculative changes.
